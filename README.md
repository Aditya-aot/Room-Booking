# Room-Booking

üîß Technical Deep Dive: Room Booking System

Built with a robust tech stack:
- Backend: Django framework (Python)
- Database: SQLite for development (with config for production deployment)
- Frontend: Django templates with HTML/CSS
- Deployment: Heroku-ready with Gunicorn and Whitenoise

Key technical implementations:
1Ô∏è‚É£ User authentication system with Django's built-in auth models
2Ô∏è‚É£ Room booking models with OneToOneField relations to user accounts
3Ô∏è‚É£ Separate models for boys and girls accommodations
4Ô∏è‚É£ Boolean fields to track room availability status
5Ô∏è‚É£ Custom forms for room selection with validation
6Ô∏è‚É£ Session management for booking flow

The architecture follows Django's MVT pattern with separate apps for accounts and booking functionality, enabling clean separation of concerns and maintainable code.

I'd love feedback from fellow developers! Check out the code: https://github.com/Aditya-aot/Room-Booking/
